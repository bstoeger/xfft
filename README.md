XFFT
====

`XFFT` (where `X` stands for `crystal` and `FFT` for Fast Fourier Transform),
is small a GUI program intended to demonstrate properties of the Fourier
transform (FT) interactively in introductory crystallography courses.

Two-dimensional data (polygons, pictures, lattices, Gaussian distributions) are
transformed by a combination of operators (FT, convolution, addition, multiplication)
and the results are ultimately displayed. Thus, numerous phenomena, such as
truncation ripples, can be demonstrated interactively.

The sofware features full undo and load/save support and a multi-document interface.

This software is based on Qt and FFTW and licensed under version 2 of the GPL.
A handful of icons were adapted from the Breeze KDE theme.
